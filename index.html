        <div class="recipe-instructions">
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <div class="instr-container">
                <button>1</button>
                <p>Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350째F (177째C).
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="instr-container">
                <button>2</button>
                <p>Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350째F
                    (177째C).Make
                    the crust: Using a food processor, pulse the graham crackers into crumbs. Pour into a medium bowl
                    and
                    stir in sugar and melted butter until combined. (You can also pulse it all together in the food
                    processor.) Mixture will be sandy. Press firmly into the bottom and slightly up the sides of a
                    9-inch or
                    10-inch springform pan. No need to grease the pan first. I use the bottom of a measuring cup to pack
                    the
                    crust down tightly. Pre-bake for 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and place the hot pan on a large
                    piece
                    of aluminum foil. The foil will wrap around the pan for the water bath in step 4. Allow crust to
                    slightly cool as you prepare the filling.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="instr-container">
                <button>3</button>
                <p><b>Make the filling:</b> Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the
                    cream
                    cheese and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed in a large bowl until the mixture is
                    smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the sour cream, vanilla extract, and lemon juice then beat
                    until fully combined. On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition until
                    just blended. After the final egg is incorporated into the batter, stop mixing. To help prevent the
                    cheesecake from deflating and cracking as it cools, avoid over-mixing the batter as best you can.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="instr-container">
                <button>4</button>
                <p>Prepare the simple water bath (see note) Boil a pot of water. You need 1 inch of water
                    in
                    your roasting pan for the water bath, so make sure you boil enough. I use an entire kettle of hot
                    water.
                    As the water is heating up, wrap the aluminum foil around the springform pan. Pour the cheesecake
                    batter
                    on top of the crust. Use a rubber spatula or spoon to smooth it into an even layer. Place the pan
                    inside
                    of a large roasting pan. Carefully pour the hot water inside of the pan and place in the oven. (Or
                    you
                    can place the roasting pan in the oven first, then pour the hot water in. Whichever is easier for
                    you.)

                <p>Bake cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost set. When it's done,
                    the
                    center of the cheesecake will slightly wobble if you gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off and
                    open
                    the oven door slightly. Let the cheesecake sit in the oven in the water bath as it cools down for 1
                    hour. Remove from the oven and water bath, then cool cheesecake completely at room temperature. Then
                    refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours or overnight.
